\subsection{Taking a Turn}\label{core:ssec:taking-a-turn}

To start your turn, you will draw the next tile in the live wall, then you will choose and discard a tile from your hand. There are many things that can happen during your turn to modify this, and they will be detailed further below.

\subsection{Calling for a Group}\label{core:ssec:calling}

As a tile is being discarded, you can call for a group using that tile. There are three types of calls:

\call{Chii}{Calling for a Run}{\ruby{吃}{チー}}
	{\symbalert Only from the player before you \\
	\symbnegate Superceded by Pon~\pr{call}{Pon}, Kan~\pr{call}{Kan}, Ron~\pr{call}{Ron}}
	{As a tile is discarded, if it was discarded by the player before you in turn order, you can call ``Chii''. Reveal two tiles from your hand that form a run with the discarded tile, then discard a tile from your hand.}
