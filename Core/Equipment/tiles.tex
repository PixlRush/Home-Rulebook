\section{Tiles}\label{core:sec:tiles}

The game is played with 136 tiles. Each tile has exactly four copies of it in the deck, and no further.

\subsection{Numbered Tiles}\label{core:ssec:num-tiles}

There are three suits of numbered tiles. These tiles may form runs. They are ordered 1 through 9 in each of the following examples:

\input{Resources/Tiles/pinzu}

\input{Resources/Tiles/souzu}

\input{Resources/Tiles/manzu}

\subsection{Honour Tiles}\label{core:ssec:hon-tiles}

% DONE: Better Tile Names
There are two suits of honour tiles. These tiles may \emph{not} form runs. Each of the honours do not follow a simple numbered structure and will be named below in each of their sections

\input{Resources/Tiles/kazehai}

\input{Resources/Tiles/sangenpai}

\subsection{Red Dora}\label{core:ssec:akadora}

Some tiles can be recoloured to be entirely Red. These tiles are known as Red or Aka Dora. Each Red Dora must replace a non-red couterpart. This ruleset uses one of each red five shown below. This then means that there are three normal fives, and one red five per suit.
