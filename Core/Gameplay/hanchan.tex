\section{Seting up a Game}\label{core:sec:hanchan}

\subsection{Determine Seating}\label{core:ssec:seating}

Before the game begins, we need to determine who is sitting where. It is recommended to do this by drawing tiles for seats. In order to actually draw tiles for seats:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Gather one copy of East, South, West, and North. ({\mahjong{1234z}})
	\item A player will thoroughly shuffle them face down and present them to the other players. ({\mahjong{XXXX}})
	\item The other players will each draw one tile, ensuring the last tile is left for the one who shuffled them. ({\mahjong{4z-1z-3z-X}})
	\item The player who drew East will select their seat, with everyone else sitting according to how the winds are placed. That is -- going counterclockwise -- East, South, West, North.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distribute Items}\label{core:ssec:distribute-items}

After which, we set up the equipment for every player. The player who is East is given the Chichaa Mark~\pr{equip}{Chichaa Mark} and the dice. Everyone is given 25,000 points in point sticks. The recommended distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{core:fig:13stick}~\pr{fig}{13stick}: 10,000 points \(\times 1\), 5,000 points \(\times 2\), 1,000 points \(\times 4\), 500 points \(\times 1\), 100 points \(\times 5\).
