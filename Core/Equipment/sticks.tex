\section{Point Sticks}\label{core:sec:sticks}

In addition to the tiles, you will need point sticks to tally the score and exchange them easily. See below for two distributions recommended for the 25,000 point starting score. Should you have any busting sticks, you may add them in at 2 per player.

\input{Resources/Tenbou/13-stick}

In order to count your score, add up the values of all sticks in your point tray, then if you are playing with bust sticks, subtract the value of the bust sticks you started with. So if you are playing with the 13 stick distribution \ar{fig}{13stick}, and you have one of each stick left in your tray, you have: \(10,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 500 + 100 - 20,000 = 6,600 \text{ points}\).
